 nohup cricscore_indicator &

 search for Cricket Score Indicator


Initially all scorecards (submenus) are disabled for reducing network usage as submenu update uses more data. The icons will not update as well since the update depends on scorecard data.

To enable scorecard for a particular match, use the "Scorecard" check button inside the submenu of that match.

Features
===================
* Shows current score as indicator label
* Updated as soon as espncricinfo is updated
* Submenu shows the scorecard of corresponding match
* Categories for International and Domestic matches
* Option to set a particular match score as indicator label
* Adds new match as it is available and deletes the unavailable ones
* Icon shows the runs scored on the last delivery of the corresponding match
* Initially all submenus (scorecards) are hidden to reduce network usage
